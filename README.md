# SQG_Code
Spectral, periodic, 2D code to integrate the SQG equations 

Basic spectral, doubly-periodic, 2D code to integrate the
SQG equations built in 1999.
It modifies an existing QG code. It has been tested 
and corrected in most comment lines but few
comments may still refer to old equations.
Requires Initial Conditions in fort.10 (example
included)
fort.9 contains basic parameters used in the run
and should be modified depending on resolution.
paran.h sets resolution parameters
Allows for beta (tested) and Coriolis f (not tested in
SQG configuration)
